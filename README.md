<p>We’ve been designing and implementing a highly accurate predictive model with datasets of attack vectors (e.g. Darkgate malware) using the LSTM “Long Short Term Memory” RNN architecture that can differentiate between normal network behavior and insecure network behavior (potential security threats). Conducted comprehensive data analysis and preprocessing to cleanse, normalize, and transform network traffic data (PCAP) into a suitable format for machine learning model training that includes PCAP File Headers (Timestamp (Micro/Nano Seconds), Magic Number, SnapLen (snapshot length), LinkType, Frame Check Sequence (FCS)).</p>
